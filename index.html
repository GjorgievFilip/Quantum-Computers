              <h1>What is a Quantum Computer?</h1>

               <p>A quantum computer is a type of computer that uses <b>quantum bits</b> (qubits), which can exist in multiple states at once through superposition and become linked through entanglement,
                         allowing it to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers. 
                          Their processing power allows them to run processes parallel to one another, unlike classical computers, which work sequentially.
                          While they are both called computers, quantum computers are not meant to replace traditional computers completly, but are rather meant as an accelerator for certain types of calucations that a typical computer would be too slow for.
                          Each type of computer is good at different tasks, and they can support each other to solve problems more efficiently</p>

                  <p class="">Quantum computers are especially useful for very complex tasks. For example, they can help with problems in science, medicine, and cryptography. They can also be used to simulate molecules and chemical reactions, which is very hard for normal computers.
                              Classical computers are still better for everyday tasks like writing emails, browsing the internet, or playing games. Quantum computers need very special conditions to work, such as extremely low temperatures, and they are expensive and difficult to build.
                              Because of this, quantum computers and classical computers will likely work together in the future.</p>

                <p>The idea of quantum computers started in the 1980s. Scientists began to think about using the laws of quantum physics to build new kinds of computers. One of the first people to talk about this idea was the physicist Richard Feynman. He said that classical computers are very slow when they try to simulate quantum systems, but quantum computers could do this much better.
                    In the 1990s, quantum computing became more important. Scientists developed the first quantum algorithms. One famous example is <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">Shor’s algorithm</a>, which showed that a quantum computer could solve certain math problems much faster than classical computers. This made many researchers interested in quantum computers, especially for security and cryptography.
                    In the early 2000s, scientists started to build small quantum computers in laboratories. These early machines only had a few qubits and were not very powerful, but they showed that quantum computing was possible. Research groups at universities and technology companies began to work on improving this technology.
                    Today, companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are developing more advanced quantum computers. These machines are still limited and cannot yet solve many real-world problems, but they are improving every year. Quantum computers are still in an early stage, but they have great potential for the future.</p>
